# GetFedProject
Concept:
You get home and want to start a meal but don’t have an idea of what to make. This is where GetFed gets you started. Get recipes based on ingredients, items on hand, or restrictions. If you’re hungry, GetFed.


Description: Recipe Website/App
Motivation for development: Recipe ideas for Home Cooks
User story:
I am a home chef and would like to use ingredients I have on hand.
I want an app that shows me the meal possibilities there are. 
I want recipes with ingredient list and directions to make a meal.

Technologies used:
Html, JavaScript, jQuery, CSS, FontAwesome, moment.js and Bootstrap
Breakdown of tasks and roles:
Doug - Back end code and created GitHub repository GetFed
Damian - Templates, merge and styling of front end and back end code
Sylvia - Front end code, styling, and presentation document

Challenges:
One of the challenges we came across was working with multiple queries, where they did not have all the same data. Also, using GitHub when branches needed to be merged into the master. Resolving the final project.

Successes
We figured out how to merge branches. Deploying the project.

Future development:
Make the website more interactive with grocery stores. For example, create a list of items needed for a meal and see if ingredients are available by location. Then have the ingredients delivered. Also, sell ad space to grocers and delivery services. Plus, able to store recipes in a cookbook or a meal planner.
